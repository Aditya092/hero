    <h4>My hero is my dog Arya who is a 2 year old Red toy poodle. The reason why I have chose him as my hero
      is that he has changed my life so much for the better and gives me so much happiness. Every time I come home he
      is the first one to greet me and it really means a lot. He also always plays with me when he knows I'm bored. But
      the main reason is what he represents which is happiness. Every time I look at him, I can't not smile. Arya will always
      be my hero
